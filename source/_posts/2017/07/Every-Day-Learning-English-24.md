"Mexico is a crucial partner for the United states in our efforts to promote a comprehensive energy security strategy and economic security for North America." said U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry.

"That is why it is a top priority to pursue a North American energy strategy that will ensure security,stability,economic growth for the United States,Mexico and for Canada."Secretary Perry made these remarks in Mexico City in mid-July when he traveled to meet with the president of Mexico and Mexico's Secretary of Energy.

Energy Secretary Perry said the work plan "will identify concrete actions that we can undertake in three areas:
* first,to accelerate development of our vast,untapped energy trade and economic development;
* second,to promote energy trade and economic development.
* and thirdly,to enhance the security,reliability and resilience of North America's energy systems." 

"The North American Energy Stragtegy,"he said,"will build upon our existing ties and bring economic benefits to both the United States and Mexico is already our second-largestenergytrading partner.Increased energy trade and bilateral investment will increase North America's self-sufficiency that will reduce our reliance on energy imports from outside the continent.Obviously it will create jobs,a lot of jobs.Good jobs.And bring down energy costs for consumers."
"We are joined together." said Secretary Perry,"in the quest for a better tomorrow.Mexico's prosperity is inextricably intertwined witth our prosperity.Our cultures are blended,our heritage and our families are shared,our economies forever linked.We must continue to develop our energy resources,invest in innovation,and build a competitive energy industry together."
