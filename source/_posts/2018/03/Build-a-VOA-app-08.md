### Now I will build a app aimed at learning English.

>The app's functions are to show VOA English News and to play the news audio.I will use the VOA API to receive the json and show the list.

What the structure will contain:
* An activity which show the list with recyclerview.
* a servive to play the audio in background
* a helper to get the json and convert the data.
* a storage helper to save the data.
