Yesterday I read an article from a WeChat Official account.

The account named AndroidDevelopment claimed that it is a technical account.However I cannot remember when it published the latest technical article (This is just a little complaint).And this time the article the account owner published is no doubt a second "chicken soup" in mind(This is to me).Or accurately it is an article aimed to propagate the author's sense of worth.This is anything but a sarcasm. I think the author's sense of worth is good and worth to learn.

The article talked about some stories about the author.One of the story is about how he try to learn from some exports in their industry.The author want to make an expert with many readers and fans pay attention to him and teach him some skills about the ways to deal with readers and keep the Official account active.But the fans of the expert are so many.How could he attract the professor's attention?The way is easy.To donate money to him.But it is not just donation simply.He donate with ï¿¥60 and keep it everyday util 10 times.Maybe it's simple,but it is really a fast and highly active.No doubt the professor pay attention to him and send a message to show appreciation to the author.And the professor not only teach him some skills about dealing with readers and fans ,but also help him spread his articles,which is beyond the pay.

The article really make me restart thinking about my lifestyle.Previously I believe it is shame to spend my parents' money buy anything but necessaries thought I am a student.So I always is a miser and even refuse to buy something maybe important to me.
I think I should try to make some change both on lifestyle and on mind .Now I write the article to show my sensibility.I hope I can feel satisfied about my action when I look back the article.
(In fact, I don't like the owner of the Official account.I think he is such a  narcissism that always sing his own praises .Although I think his sense of worth is correct and some principles,he make me feel uncomfortable about a narcissism.I hope one day I can go beyond him )
